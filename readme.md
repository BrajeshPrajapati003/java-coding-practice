## 📚 Overview

This is my all-in-one Java problem-solving and concept-practice repo, structured for efficiency, reusability, and clarity. It brings together all topic-based Java projects into one monorepo — perfect for focused revision, interview prep, and collaborative development.

## 🧱 Project Structure

Each subfolder in this repository represents a **single Java concept or topic**, and includes:

- `.java` solution files
- A dedicated `README.md` with topic description and purpose
- Practice problems, real-world code snippets, and concept highlights

✅ This layout is ideal for both **learning** and **quick referencing**.
