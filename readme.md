# Java Coding Practice Repository

Welcome to the `java-coding-practice` repository! 🚀  
This is a structured collection of Java programs organized by topic. It’s designed for revision, problem-solving, and mastering both fundamentals and advanced concepts of Java.

## 📂 Topics Covered

Below is the list of all folders and what they contain:

### 🧱 Core Java

- **Abstract Class** – Abstract methods, base class implementation, and real-world examples.
- **ArrayList** – Use of Java’s dynamic array structure and generic types.
- **arrays** – Classic problems on arrays: sorting, searching, manipulation.
- **Class and Object** – Core OOP building blocks including attributes and behavior.
- **EnumSet** – Specialized Set implementations for enums, including best practices.
- **Exception Handling** – Try-catch, throws, custom exceptions, and runtime flow.
- **File Handling** – File input/output using `File`, `BufferedReader`, and NIO.
- **HashMap** – Key-value storage, collision handling, and iterations.
- **HashSet** – Unique collections, hashing behavior, and performance tests.
- **Inheritance** – Reusability of code via extends, super keyword, and multilevel inheritance.
- **Interface** – Full abstraction, polymorphism, and multiple inheritance.

### 🔥 Intermediate & Functional Programming

- **Lambda Expressions** – Anonymous functions and functional programming with streams.
- **linked list** – Single/double circular linked list operations.
- **Logic Building** – Pure logic questions to test your brain 🧠.
- **Looping Statement** – Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) with condition-based examples.
- **Math** – Number theory, factorials, prime checks, GCD, LCM, etc.
- **Method Overloading** – Compile-time polymorphism through overloaded methods.
- **Method With VarArgs** – Flexible argument count using variable-length arguments.
- **Multithreading** – Thread creation, synchronization, race conditions, and deadlocks.

### 🧠 Problem Solving & DSA

- **Problem Solving** – Mixed bag of real-world and algorithmic Java problems.
- **Queue** – FIFO structure using `Queue`, `LinkedList`, and `PriorityQueue`.
- **Recursion** – Recursive methods, base cases, and backtracking principles.
- **Stack** – LIFO structure using `Stack` class and applications like expression evaluation.
- **Strings** – Palindromes, string reversal, substrings, character frequencies, and more.

### 🌲 Tree & Map

- **Binary Tree** – Node-based structures, traversal (in/pre/post), and construction.
- **TreeMap** – Sorted maps using red-black tree implementation.
- **Treeset** – Sorted set with unique elements.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder contains:
- `.java` source files
- Optionally: input/output samples, problem statements
- Subfolders or topics where needed
- You can navigate and run them in any Java IDE like IntelliJ or VS Code.

## 🧹 .gitignore (already included)

The `.gitignore` ensures that:
- IDE-specific files (like `.iml`, `.idea/`)
- Compiled `.class` files
- OS junk (e.g., `Thumbs.db`, `.DS_Store`)
are excluded from Git tracking.
